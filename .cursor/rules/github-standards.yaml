      When updating GitHub-related content:

      1. Commit Messages:
         - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
         - Include relevant issue numbers if applicable
         - Follow conventional commit format when possible:
           ```
           type(scope): description
           ```
           Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

      2. Branch Management:
         - Create feature branches for new features
         - Use descriptive branch names
         - Keep branches up to date with main

      3. Pull Requests:
         - Include a clear description
         - Reference related issues
         - Add screenshots for visual changes
         - Keep PRs focused and manageable

      4. Documentation:
         - Update README.md for significant changes
         - Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date
         - Document breaking changes

      5. Version Control:
         - Don't commit sensitive information
         - Use .gitignore appropriately
         - Keep commits atomic and focused

      6. GitHub Actions:
         - Document workflow changes
         - Test workflows before merging
         - Keep secrets secure
