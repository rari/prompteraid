# GitHub Update Standards

When updating GitHub-related content:

## 1. Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include relevant issue numbers if applicable
- Follow conventional commit format when possible:
  ```
  type(scope): description
  ```
  Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## 2. Branch Management
- Create feature branches for new features
- Use descriptive branch names
- Keep branches up to date with main

## 3. Pull Requests
- Include a clear description
- Reference related issues
- Add screenshots for visual changes
- Keep PRs focused and manageable

## 4. Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date
- Document breaking changes

## 5. Version Control
- Don't commit sensitive information
- Use .gitignore appropriately
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## 6. GitHub Actions
- Document workflow changes
- Test workflows before merging
- Keep secrets secure

## Examples

### Good Commit Message
```bash
git commit -m "fix(assets): correct texture paths in seasonal mods"
```

### Secure Data Handling
```bash
# Bad: Sensitive data in commit
API_KEY=1234567890abcdef

# Good: Using environment variables
API_KEY=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```
